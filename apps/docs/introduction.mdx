## What is Kinpal?

Kinpal is a tool for creating scheduling meeting polls. It's designed to help people find a common time to schedule a meeting or event.

## What is a Scheduling Meeting Poll?

Scheduling meeting polls help you find a time that works for everyone. The host
of the meeting will typically select a few date and time options for participants to vote
for and then select the most suitable option.
