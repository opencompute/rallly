Kinpal is open-source and always free for personal use.
If you want to run a multi-user setup, we ask that you purchase a license key.

<Note>
The license key you purchase is a **perpetual license specifically for Kinpal v4.x versions**. This means your license will grant you access to all features and updates within the entire Kinpal v4 series for the user tier you've selected.
</Note>

## Activating Your License

Once you have your license key, you can activate it in your self-hosted Kinpal instance:

1.  Log in to your Kinpal instance as an administrator.
2.  Navigate to the [Control Panel](/self-hosting/control-panel).
3.  Select **License**.
4.  Enter your license key in the provided field and click **Activate**.

Your instance will now be licensed for multi-user access according to your chosen tier.

## Spaces and Collaboration

Starting with Kinpal v4.3.0, **Spaces** allow you to create collaborative workspaces where you can invite other users to work together on polls. Each Space has a seat limit based on your licensing tier:

- **Personal**: Cannot invite other members (1 seat only)
- **Plus**: Up to 5 members per Space
- **Organization**: Up to 50 members per Space  
- **Enterprise**: Up to 100 members per Space

Members invited to a Space can create and manage polls within that workspace, making it easier for teams and organizations to collaborate on scheduling.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="What constitutes a user?">
Only individuals with a **registered user account** on your Kinpal instance count towards your user limit. People who participate in polls without being registered (i.e., guest voters) **do not** count as users for licensing purposes.

When you invite someone to a Space, they become a member of that Space and count towards both your instance user limit and the Space's seat limit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my user limit?">
We operate an **honor system** for user limits. If you exceed your user limit, your instance will continue to function without any interruption. You'll simply see a friendly reminder asking you to upgrade to a higher tier.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get an invoice?">
For Plus and Organization tiers, you'll automatically receive a payment receipt via email right after your purchase. This receipt contains all the necessary transaction details for your accounting and tax purposes. Formal invoices are a feature specifically included with our Enterprise tier. If you have any questions about your receipt, or if you're an Enterprise customer needing an invoice, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact/support).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get a refund?">
Our license keys provide perpetual access and cannot be "returned".
Due to the nature of these licenses and the costs associated with processing transactions, we are unable to offer refunds.
Issuing a refund would mean we incur a financial loss while you retain the perpetual license.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does an Enterprise license cost?">
The Enterprise license is designed for organizations typically needing support for **more than 50 users**, or those with other specific requirements.

Pricing for Enterprise licenses is **customized** based on the scale of your deployment and specific needs.
We offer a **one-time perpetual license fee** that provides broad usage rights for your organization.
This approach ensures you get a fair price tailored to your situation, rather than a fixed per-user calculation that may not be suitable for very large organizations.

All Enterprise licenses include access to updates and priority support.
