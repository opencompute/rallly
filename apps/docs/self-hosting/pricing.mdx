Kinpal is open-source and always free (as in beer) for personal use. If you want to enable multi-user support for your team or organization, you’ll need a license key. This one-time purchase helps fund ongoing development and ensures Kinpal remains sustainable.

**Every license includes:**
- All updates for your purchased version
- One-time payment, no subscriptions
- Access to private support channels

## The Honor System

We do not strictly enforce user limits—if your instance exceeds the recommended user count, you’ll simply see a reminder to purchase a license. Your instance will continue to work without interruption.

We rely on your honesty and support to keep Kinpal open source and sustainable. If you find Kinpal valuable and your usage exceeds the free tier, please consider purchasing a license to help fund further development.
