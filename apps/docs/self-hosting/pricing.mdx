description: How much does it cost to self-host Kinpal?
---

Kinpal is **completely free** to self-host.
But free software doesn’t mean it’s without cost.
Someone has to develop, maintain, and support it.
If you find Kinpal useful you can help support further development by paying a one-time fee.

## Suggested Price

We believe $42 USD is a very fair price for the time and effort that's gone into making this product.
It's also the cost of a yearly subscription to the [official managed service](https://kinpal.com).
If you find Kinpal useful and can afford to pay, please consider paying this amount.
