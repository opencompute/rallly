## How Seat-Based Billing Works

Kinpal spaces use a seat-based pricing model that scales with your team size:

<Card title="Seat-Based Pricing Benefits" icon="users">
- **Easy scaling** - add or remove seats as your team changes
- **Centralized billing** - one subscription for your entire team
- **Pro features for all** - every member gets Pro benefits
</Card>

## Understanding Seats

### What is a Seat?
A seat represents one team member's access to your Pro space. Each member you invite to your space requires one seat.

### Seat Allocation
- **Used Seats**: Current number of active members in your space
- **Total Seats**: Maximum number of members you're paying for
- **Available Seats**: Remaining seats you can fill without increasing your bill

<Note>
You must have at least as many total seats as used seats. You cannot reduce total seats below your current member count.
</Note>

## Managing Your Subscription

### Upgrading to Pro

To upgrade your space to Pro:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Billing Settings">
    Go to your space settings and select the "Billing" tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Your Plan">
    Select either monthly or yearly Pro billing. Yearly billing offers a discount.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Payment">
    Enter your payment details and complete the subscription setup through Stripe.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Seats

You can adjust your seat allocation at any time:

#### Adding Seats
When you need to invite more members:

1. **Navigate to Billing Settings**
2. **Click "Manage Seats"**
3. **Increase the seat count** to accommodate new members
4. **Confirm the changes** - billing will be prorated immediately

#### Removing Seats
To reduce costs when team members leave:

1. **Remove members** from your space first
2. **Go to Billing Settings** and click "Manage Seats"
3. **Decrease the seat count** to match your current needs
4. **Confirm the changes** - adjustments will be credited to your next bill

<Warning>
You cannot reduce seats below your current member count. Remove members first, then adjust seat allocation.

    When you add seats mid-cycle, you're charged a prorated amount for the remaining days in your billing period. When you remove seats, the credit is applied to your next bill.
