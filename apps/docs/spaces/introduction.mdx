## What are Spaces?

Spaces are Kinpal's solution for team and organizational collaboration. Instead of everyone managing their own individual Pro subscriptions, spaces allow organizations to have centralized billing and member management under a single subscription.

<Card title="Key Benefits" icon="rocket">
  - **Centralized Billing**: One subscription covers all team members
  - **Team Collaboration**: Share and organize polls within your organization
  - **Member Management**: Invite and manage team members from one place
  - **Seat-Based Pricing**: Pay only for the seats you need and scale as you grow
</Card>

## How Spaces Work

When you create a space, you become the space owner and can:

- **Invite team members** to join your space
- **Manage billing** for the entire team
- **Add or remove seats** as your team grows or changes
- **Organize polls** within your team or organization

All members of a Pro space get access to Pro features without needing their own individual subscriptions.
